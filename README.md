# Spot-Pricing Challenge
## Overview
This repository provides data and tools for exploring the affect of weather data, and stock prices to the hourly electricity prices in Finland. The Data folder contains pickle files generated by the `generate_*.py` -scripts. You can quickstart from `main.py` which already imports the pickle files and shows their correlation to the hourly electricity price, or you can modify the data via the `generate_*.py` -scripts.

It is worth noting that the `stock_prices.pkl` is not as long as the other dataset due to limitations on Yahoo Finance API. Below are the ticker explanations for the stock data:

    "^GSPC",  # S&P 500 Index
    "CL=F",   # Crude Oil (WTI)
    "BZ=F",   # Brent Crude Oil
    "UNG",    # United States Natural Gas Fund
    "GC=F",   # Gold Futures
    "URA",    # Global X Uranium ETF
    "XLE"     # Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund
